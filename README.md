# Final Project: Exchange Rates

### Our research is on factors that influence exchange rate. We recognized that some currencies had been kept dropping in the past few years, and we would like to test if certain kinds of currency are influence more by certain factor. So we take Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and Japanese yen as an example to test if their drop in price are due to different primary factors. 

### Why is it important? The exchange rate can be defined as "the rate at which one country's currency may be converted into another.", the basic idea is that money’s worth is dependent on what it can be used to buy. So it relates to our everyday life. And it may fluctuate daily with the changing market forces of supply and demand of currencies from one country to another. Also, the exchange rate is probably the most important price in any economy, for it affects and is affected by all other prices. In today’s highly integrated world economic system, the behavior of exchange rate has always caught the attention of economic policy makers. A country's foreign exchange rate provides a window to its economic stability, which is why it is constantly watched and analyzed.

### we have some basic factors that influence foreign exchange rate, including interest rate, inflation rate, balance of trade, GDP grwoth rate, US Fed fund rate, USDX, and major commodity prices.
