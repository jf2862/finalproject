# Final Project: Exchange Rates

##### Our research is on factors that influence exchange rate. We recognized that some currencies had been kept dropping in the past few years, and we would like to test if certain kinds of currency are influence more by certain factor. So we take Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and Japanese yen as an example to test if their drop in price are due to different primary factors. 

##### Why is it important? The exchange rate can be defined as "the rate at which one country's currency may be converted into another.", the basic idea is that money’s worth is dependent on what it can be used to buy. So it relates to our everyday life. And it may fluctuate daily with the changing market forces of supply and demand of currencies from one country to another. Also, the exchange rate is probably the most important price in any economy, for it affects and is affected by all other prices. In today’s highly integrated world economic system, the behavior of exchange rate has always caught the attention of economic policy makers. A country's foreign exchange rate provides a window to its economic stability, which is why it is constantly watched and analyzed.

##### we have some basic factors that influence foreign exchange rate, including interest rate, inflation rate, balance of trade, GDP grwoth rate, US Fed fund rate, USDX, and major commodity prices.

##### Follwing is the results of R sqare from each signle linear regression we preformed

| Currency | Crude Oil Price | Alumimun Price | Iron Ore Price | GDP Growth Rate | Balance of Trade | Interest Rate | USD Funds Rate | USDX |
| AUD | 0.665 | 0.560 | 0.753 | 0.055 | 0.023 | 0.110 | 0.694 | 0.032 | 0.778 |
| CAD | 0.748 | 0.500 | 0.804 | 0.413 | 0.031 | 0.123 | 0.747 | 0.055 | 0.839 |
| JPY | 0.419 | 0.425 | 0.567 | 0.136 | 0.005 | 0.011 | 0.000 | 0.015 | 0.559 |


##### It implies that both Australia and Canada are important iron and aluminum exporters. They also have a very deep tie to the oil business, which makes Australian dollar and Canadian dollar favorite of currency traders to play on oil prices. Also, around 70% of Canadian crude oil production was exported to the U.S. (USDX) is a measure of the value of the U.S. dollar relative to majority of its most significant trading partners. So we confirm our finding that the economy of US and Canada are highly correlated. 

##### For Japan, there’s lots of government intervention so we do not see so much strong correlation on the factors as we see in Canadian dollar and Australian dollar. The economic policy adopted by Abe including inflation targeting at 2% annual rate and lower the interest rate to zero or even negative, and correction of the excessive yen appreciation.
